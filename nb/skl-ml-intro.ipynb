    "Although vastly outdated the common classification of machine learning techniques\n",
    "into groups follows.\n",
    "The terminology that we often see in ML consist of a *problem* - which is\n",
    "our data from which we want to build a model; a *model* - which is a trained\n",
    "machine learning algorithm that behaves in a manner that mirrors a real\n",
    "process that makes the problem into a solution; and a *solution*\n",
    "or *answer* - which is the result that the mirrored real process builds from the problem.\n",
    "For example, in a bakery the problem is flour, salt, eggs and water,\n",
    "the model is the baking process and the solution is bread.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Supervised Learning** one has some answers to the problem\n",
    "and plans to automate the solution to this problem.\n",
    "The algorithms will attempt to find how data inputs map to the solutions.\n",
    "After which the resulting models will be able to give a solution\n",
    "to data never seen before.\n",
    "We often subdivide supervised learning further into.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Classification*, where one predicts crisps classes.\n",
    "  In other words one identifies, for example,\n",
    "  ships from among cars.\n",
    "  But there is no middle ground, an amphibious vehicle\n",
    "  will be identified as a car or as a ship.\n",
    "  Classification is the most common problem in the world around us,\n",
    "  e.g. is the figure I'm walking towards a person or a lamp post?\n",
    "  are they moving away or towards me?\n",
    "  These are problems we humans face thousands of times during a day.\n",
    "  Hence classification is also the most common ML implementation\n",
    "  out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Regression*, where the answers are ordered numbers.\n",
    "  The difference against classification is that the answer\n",
    "  from a regression algorithm is a value anywhere within\n",
    "  a reasonable range.\n",
    "  We can have $27$ as the answer to a problem, so we can have $42$;\n",
    "  and also any value in between, such as $32.64$.\n",
    "  Regression is most often used for ranking lists of items.\n",
    "  Yes, your web search and your recommendation lists on shopping\n",
    "  websites are ordered according to regressions.\n",
    "  Another common use for regression algorithms is in the area\n",
    "  of physical control of matter.\n",
    "  Since matter has continuous nature in the world we see,\n",
    "  managing water levels, wind speeds, temperature, or tremor intensity;\n",
