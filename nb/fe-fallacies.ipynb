    "> However, among women with no breast cancer at all, about 7% will get a positive reading on the mammogram,\n",
    "> leading to further tests and biopsies and so on.\n",

    "(normally negative, e.g. non-fraud, healthy) over others.\n",
    "It is often better to reduce the dataset and train on a sample where\n",
    "classes do not have orders of magnitude differences in population.\n",
    "In other words, a dataset is often as good (and as big)\n",
    "as the number of samples of the smaller class in the data.\n",
