    "\n",
    "-   Try different classifiers!  From simple ones advancing to more complex ones.\n",
    "    This is a more-or-less real world and a difficult problem, do not expect accuracy\n",
    "    of your classifier to be in the 90% range.  More than 80% accuracy is good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   This project is a case of very heterogeneous features across a lot of data\n",
    "    but not much data that can be used by a classifier trainer.  This scenario\n",
    "    is often true in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Most of the data is categorical in nature (names of people), you will be working\n",
    "    with sparse matrices of zeros and ones most of the time.  Transform your data into\n",
    "    these matrices after filtering out the data you do not need.  Changing every actor's\n",
    "    name into a dummy-variable column is likely to bust out the memory of the most\n",
    "    capable machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Remember that the data is very, very high-dimensional.  And, due to the big amount\n",
    "    of categorical variables most of the decision boundaries are aligned to the axes\n",
    "    in some dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Several directors are often writers on their movies, several despise the idea.\n",
    "    The `writer` feature will be very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Quentin Tarantino is known for working with a very small and selected group of actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A classifier is trained badly with classes of different magnitudes, i.e. one class\n",
    "    with 10 samples and another with 10 000 samples.  When building the training set\n",
    "    try to even out the class magnitude.  This means that for the classifier on the\n",
    "    level 1, you probably will get best results with a total training set of less than\n",
    "    100 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   With datasets that are quite small (as most training sets will be here) the\n",
    "    cross-validation technique should be leave-one-out.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When building a list of directors you may want to fine-tune it by hand.\n",
    "    It is completely fine to limit your classifier to Hollywood-only movies.\n",
    "    IMDB contains movies from several countries, which can make the classifier\n",
    "    work based on a country boundary by guessing across the cast for names that\n",
    "    are known in one country only.  This may make the classifier work worse\n",
    "    between directors in the same country.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When building the clusters it may be wise to cluster only directors with at least 2 movies\n",
    "    on their making.  This allows you to try more expensive techniques and makes it easier\n",
    "    to avoid dirty data."
