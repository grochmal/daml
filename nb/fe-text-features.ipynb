    "Actually feature engineering is not a collection of techniques\n",
    "but a generic name to define tasks performed around input data to our model.\n",
    "These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modifying existing features - e.g. scaling\n",
    "- Selecting only a subset of features - e.g. removing highly correlated features\n",
    "- Building new features from existing ones - e.g. squaring features to get only positive values\n",
    "- Encoding features in a different representation - e.g. one-hot-encoding\n",
    "- Learning new features from data - e.g. huge neural networks fed with lots of data\n",
    "\n",
    "The last example requires really huge amounts of data,\n",
    "hundreds of millions of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plethora of texts on feature engineering an selection but perhaps\n",
    "the most important idea about building and selecting features in the current\n",
    "day and age is that **no one has authoritative answers on feature engineering**.\n",
    "There are well proven statistical techniques for feature selection\n",
    "but these require the knowledge of complete correlations across all\n",
    "combinations of features, often an infeasible task.\n",
    "Moreover these selection techniques are proven for linear relations\n",
    "across data and outputs,\n",
    "it has been proven that such techniques *lose information*\n",
    "about non-linear relations within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom line of feature engineering is that in the present times\n",
    "there is no single or combination of techniques that can substitute\n",
    "a human being and his capacity of understanding the data.\n",
    "Instead of relying on feature engineering techniques to build or\n",
    "select features one uses these techniques and builds sample models\n",
    "in order to gain understanding about the data.\n",
    "Then one uses that information about the data to construct his own\n",
    "pipelines feeding the data into the model.\n",
    "Despite advances, at the time of writing, feature engineering\n",
