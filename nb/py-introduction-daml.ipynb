    "    For plotting we will see the classical, if not a bit old,\n",
    "    graph drawing library.\n",
    "    Matplotlib is clunky at times but its well proven design allows\n",

    "    Yet, one needs to understand the boring parts before safely automating them away.\n",
    "    We look at how *SciKit* uses conventions and helper functions to perform its job.\n",

    "9.  **Decision Trees (and Random Forests) and SVMs**:\n",
    "    More powerful algorithms for classification and regression are explored.\n",
    "    Both, Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), are very powerful\n",
    "    but have some limitations.\n",
    "    We will explore the good and bad sides of the techniques.\n",

    "    We define *Online Learning* and skim over the concepts\n",
    "    of neural networks.\n",
    "    *Neural Networks* (NNs) are a very big topic with several books on.\n",
