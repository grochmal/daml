    "We will deal very little with the object oriented nature of Python\n",
    "but we will need to know some bits about objects.  An object is an encapsulation of state\n",
    "together with methods (functions) that operate on this state.  In Python *object state\n",
    "and object methods live in different places in memory*, the first argument to all\n",
    "normal methods of an object points to the actual state encapsulated by the current\n",
    "instance of the object.  By convention we use `self` as the name of the first argument\n",
    "of the object methods, and this is a very strong convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "After constructing an object the `__init__` method is invoked, it takes the `self` argument\n",
    "and then anything that we wish to be stored or used for constructing an instance of our object.\n",
    "Optional arguments are accepted and encouraged within the definition of `__init__`, these optional\n",
    "arguments make for what in other languages is accomplished with multiple constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python function is actually an object.  The `def` simply defines and object which has a\n",
    "`__call__` method, this method is invoked when the object is called (by placing brackets after it).\n",
    "The dictionaries and lists are just Python objects too, these define the `__getitem__` method.\n",
    "In Python these *dunder* (double underscore) methods define the protocols of the basic objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows is an example of a multi-protocol object,\n",
    "with a similar `__getitem__` as the multidimensional array object which we will see\n",
    "when we learn about *NumPy*.\n",
    "At first sight the *NumPy* like objects seem very strange\n",
    "but the example here hopefully clears some confusion\n",
    "in that those objects are just python.\n",
    "After we see *NumPy* I encourage you to come back here and look at this object again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: do not worry if you do not understand what is happening below,\n",
    "we will not explicitly cover it.\n",
    "On the other hand, if you know Python well and are interested in what goes\n",
    "behind the scenes in the data manipulation libraries this object outlines it."
