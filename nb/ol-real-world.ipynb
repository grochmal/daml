    "## Bias, Variance Trade-Off - Validate your Model!\n",
    "\n",
    "The *bias vs variance* trade-off argues that a model that is not complex enough\n",
    "will *underfit* the data, and a model that is too complex will *overfit* the data.\n",
    "We control model complexity through model hyperparameters,\n",
    "and we can estimate a good complexity by trying several hyperparameters and\n",
    "cross-validating their performance.\n",
    "The difficult part of the art of machine learning is not making a model work,\n",
    "it is to prove that is works and that it will work for new data.\n",
    "Moreover, depending of the problem we may want to validate a model for different things,\n",
    "e.g. in a fraud detection model we want the recall\n",
    "of fraud data points to be the most important validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model will work with new data, just cross-validating it is not enough.\n",
    "Cross-validation allows us to select the best hyperparameters,\n",
    "and gives us a good estimate of how well a model performs;\n",
    "but it does not give us an estimate of how badly our model can perform on new data,\n",
    "i.e. we do not have a generalization baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate how our model performs against new data, we need to separate our data\n",
    "into a training and test sets and only then perform cross-validation on the training set alone.\n",
    "The resulting model's generalization can then be evaluated on the test set.\n",
    "In other words, we now have a test set, and several folds\n",
    "which are the training and validation sets.\n",
    "This ensures that the model sees only the training set during the tuning of its parameters,\n",
    "and sees only the training and validation sets during the tuning of its hyperparameters.\n",
    "In `sklearn` the test set splitting and cross-validation are done with similar procedures.\n",
    "In other libraries, notably neural network libraries, the training (fitting) of the model\n",
    "will *always perform (cross) validation* as part of the training.\n",
    "As the bracket suggest it may not be a full cross-validation depending on the library\n",
    "but do not get fooled by examples using such libraries in which\n",

    "You may need to slightly re-tune the hyperparameters\n",

    "Retraining a new model at certain intervals does not need to create downtimes,\n",
